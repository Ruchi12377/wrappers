# Developing a Wasm Wrapper

There are two types of Foreign Data Wrappers supported by the Wrappers Framework:

- [Native Wrappers](#native-wrappers): Contributions currently unsupported.
- [Wasm Wrappers](#wasm-wrappers): Contributions supported.

## Native Wrappers

Unfortunately, we cannot support native community Wrappers this repo until the Wrappers API is stabilized. If you have an idea for a Wrapper, you can [vote your favorite Wrapper](https://github.com/supabase/wrappers/discussions/136). Once we release Wrappers 1.0, we will support native community Wrappers within the Wrappers repo.

In the meantime you can develop a WASM wrapper, which can be installed on any Postgres instance with `wrappers v0.4.0+`

## Wasm Wrappers
